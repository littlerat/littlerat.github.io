I'll have you know I set a new PB the other day. 3 whole seconds bitch, count 'em and weep. \r\n<SB> if i'm not bound by time, then it could be an eternity \r\n<SB> and only feel like an instant for you \r\n<Nab> Sounds like the only sex you ever had was with Steven Hawkings, SB. Are those the sweet nothings he whispered in your ear? \r\n<SB> steven hawkings is your father \r\n<SB> which is why he doesn't mind when i'm boning your mother \r\n<Nab> I would've been YOUR father, but the dog and various other creatures beat me up the stairs. \r\n<SB> in fact, he pays me to do it \r\n<Nab> SB, we both know the only monetary transaction you've ever made sucessfully was buying the whole panties department at Wal mart for yourself. \r\n<Nab> And paying redneck men to dress in them for you. \r\n<SB> You mean for your mother\r\n<Nab> Once again SB. You're doing the time warp with me. Back to 1999. Thankfully you left out the pelvic thrusts or none of us would ever get erect again. \r\n<SB> once again, your mother is calling my name \r\n<SB> excuse me \r\n<Nab> The only reason my mother would call your name out is in a courtroom, accusing you of raping kids on the local street corner \r\n<SB> yeah, she likes to play courtroom in the sack \r\n<SB> it turns her on \r\n<Nab> So you use a \"sack\" to grab and rape teh kiddies? What's more, the only court you know anything about is courting, as in dating, in medieval times. Where they marry and fuck girls at 14. \r\n<Nab> And younger. \r\n<SB> 14...YEAH! your mom likes it at 14 \r\n<SB> which is 2pm \r\n<SB> btw \r\n<Nab> Isn't 2pm the time you have those rectal examinations? Or did the AIDS clear up already? \r\n<Nab> We tried to tell you. Use protection when you're with the AFRICAN kids. \r\n<SB> everyone has aids \r\n<SB> your mom is my aid \r\n<Nab> your mom needed FIRST aid when I was done pounding her\r\n<SB> your mom...needed first aid? \r\n<SB> damnit, i told steven not to beat her \r\n<Nab> I quite clearly said YOUR mom. I guess you've picked up the misreading of sentences from those kids who can't read. Which you take advantage of, by shoving your slobbering purple peen deep into their anus. \r\n<SB> i quite clearly made your mom a happier person \r\n<Nab> The only person you ever made happy was your dad, when you first bent over to tie your shoe and forgot you weren't wearing any pants. \r\n<SB> apparently not \r\n<Nab> And that's where it allll began \r\n<Azza|Elsewhere> XD \r\n<Azza|Elsewhere> Nab... \r\n<Azza|Elsewhere> <3 \r\n<SB> being that your mom is crying in joy currently \r\n<Nab> lol, someone's never heard of FAKING IT. \r\n<SB> if only your mom knew how to fake... \r\n<Nab> To be honest, you fucking my mum doesn't gain you any plus points here. If anything it drowns you in massive lose. As if you needed more of that. \r\n<Azza|Elsewhere> Hm. \r\n<Nab> SB, I think I know my mum, and your mum, and your dad, and your little sister, better than you do. \r\n<SB> interesting... \r\n<SB> i told your mother to stop beating you \r\n<SB> i guess she only hits you harder now \r\n<SB> brain damage is so cruel... \r\n<Nab> And I told your mother to stop beating off over me. \r\n<Nab> Brain Damage...
